## My process
- I initiated the React project with the help of Vite (Vite optimizes code compilation and execution, which can result in a better end-user experience due to faster loading times and lower resource usage.).
- For styling purposes and more added responsivness, I utilized tailwind CSS which narrows down the utilization of extra css files and I quite prefer it in my projects.
- I read through the Ipify Documentation on how to utilize the API and get the necessary outputs (in JSON) and display the data to the required IP Address.
- Axios was used to fetch the API.
- Functional programming allowed me to utilized multiple components and break them into seperate components and use props to handle the job.
- Multiple hooks such as useState, useEffect etc have been utilized for necessary operations.
